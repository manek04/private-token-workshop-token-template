# Aleo Compliant Private Tokens Workshop ‚Äî Token Template üõ°

Welcome to the Aleo Compliant Private Tokens Workshop, a practical, hands-on session designed to teach you how to create privacy-preserving and regulation-compliant tokens on the Aleo blockchain.
This workshop covers the core principles of token privacy, compliance strategies, and the zero-knowledge technology that powers Aleo‚Äôs privacy-focused ecosystem.

# üéØ Workshop Overview
In this session, you'll learn how to:
Mint both public and private tokens
Transfer tokens in public and private modes
Deploy your token program to the Aleo blockchain
Participants will gain a clear understanding of the balance between public transparency (for compliance and auditing) and private execution (for confidentiality and user privacy).

# üß© Core Functions

## Mint_public
Creates tokens that are visible and traceable on-chain ‚Äî useful for regulatory oversight and compliance reporting.

## Mint_private
Generates tokens privately using zero-knowledge proofs, keeping balances and ownership hidden from public view.

## Transfer_public
Moves tokens publicly on-chain, visible to everyone. Ideal for regulated or auditable transactions.
transfer_private
Transfers tokens confidentially using zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring privacy without revealing transaction details.
